  abstract = {Street networks are ubiquitous components of cities, guiding their development and enabling movement from place to place; street networks are also the critical components of many urban analytical methods. However, their graph representation is often designed primarily for transportation purposes. This representation is less suitable for other use cases where transportation networks need to be simplified as a mandatory pre-processing step, e.g., in the case of morphological analysis, visual navigation, or drone flight routing. While the urgent demand for automated pre-processing methods comes from various fields, it is still an unsolved challenge. In this article, we tackle this challenge by proposing a cheap computational heuristic for the identification of ``face artifacts'', i.e., geometries that are enclosed by transportation edges but do not represent urban blocks. The heuristic is based on combining the frequency distributions of shape compactness metrics and area measurements of street network face polygons. We test our method on 131 globally sampled large cities and show that it successfully identifies face artifacts in 89{\textbackslash}\% of analyzed cities. Our heuristic of detecting artifacts caused by data being collected for another purpose is the first step towards an automated street network simplification workflow. Moreover, the proposed face artifact index uncovers differences in structural rules guiding the development of cities in different world regions.},

Comprehensive and openly accessible building stock data can enable impactful research exploring the most effective policy options. In Europe, efforts from citizen and governments generated numerous relevant datasets but these are fragmented and heterogeneous, thus hindering their usability. Here, we present eubucco v0.1, a database of individual building footprints for {\textasciitilde}202 million buildings across the 27 European Union countries and Switzerland. Three main attributes -- building height, construction year and type -- are included for respectively 73\%, 24\% and 46\% of the buildings. We identify, collect and harmonize 50 open government datasets and OpenStreetMap, and perform extensive validation analyses to assess the quality, consistency and completeness of the data in every country. eubucco v0.1 provides the basis for high-resolution urban sustainability studies across scales -- continental, comparative or local studies -- using a centralized source and is relevant for a variety of use cases, e.g., for energy system analysis or natural hazard risk assessments.},

abstract = {Studies have shown that urban vegetation can be an effective strategy for reducing energy consumption in urban buildings by regulating the microclimate and shading solar radiation on building surfaces. However, an understanding of the potential energy savings of vegetation morphological planning at the urban scale is still lacking, particularly regarding the quantitative correlation between urban vegetation morphology and its impact on urban building energy use. The morphology of the metropolitan area in Nanjing, a typical hot summer/cold winter city in eastern China, was statistically analyzed, and 40 urban building-vegetation morphological prototypes were extracted. Using the proposed co-simulation technique for urban microclimate and urban building energy, the summer and winter building energy consumption of the prototypes were simulated. A quantitative analysis was conducted on the relationship between urban vegetation morphology indexes and building energy consumption. The results indicate that strategically planned urban vegetation morphology can significantly reduce urban building energy consumption. In the summer, vegetation close to the geometric center of the site, uniformly distributed and highly mixed with buildings, can significantly reduce the building energy consumption; in the winter, the opposite is true. The presented findings provide designers and planners with strategies for incorporating urban vegetation morphology design into the construction of energy efficient cities.}

abstract = {Houses with better street design are found to relate to a price premium. Prior studies mainly present the street quality using objective indicators like tree counts and distance to parks with land use data, or most recently using the greenery view index extracted from street view imagery (SVI). We argue that objective indicators cannot completely describe people‚Äôs sense of a place, as perception is a highly subjective process. We hypothesize that subjective measures using visual surveys could capture more subtle human perceptions, thus providing stronger predictive power to housing prices. However, the role of subjectively measured street design qualities is less known due to the lack of large-scale perception data. To test our hypothesis, we first collected designers‚Äô perceptions on five urban design qualities from pairwise SVIs rankings in Shanghai with an online visual survey. Unlike the mainstream of using generic image features, we followed urban design theory and used rule-based features, i.e., about thirty streetscape elements extracted from SVIs to train machine learning (ML) models to predict subjective perceptions. The predictive power of five qualities versus ten selected individual streetscapes on housing price were compared using the hedonic price model. Besides the standard ordinary least squares (OLS), spatial regression and geographical weighted regression (GWR) were also developed to account for the spatial dependence and heterogeneity effects. We found both subjectively measured design qualities and objective indicators outperformed housing structural attributes in explaining housing price. While the objective view indexes collectively explained more price variances, the five perceptions individually exhibited stronger strength. Third, less-studied perceptions like ‚Äúhuman scale‚Äù showed stronger strength than commonly studied ‚Äúsafety‚Äù and ‚Äúenclosure‚Äù. Fourth, less-studied view indexes like ‚Äúperson‚Äù and ‚Äúfence‚Äù outperformed ubiquitous features like trees and buildings. Lastly, prior studies might have resulted in biased estimations due to ignoring the multicollinear issues between the sky, tree and building views. Our study addressed the effectiveness of incorporating subjective perceptions at a micro level to infer housing prices. Correlations between subjective perceptions were strong while that of objective indicators were negligible, therefore subjective perceptions can complement the objective indicators. The findings provide important reference to decision makers when selecting street quality indicators to infer urban design, city planning and community and housing development plans.}
