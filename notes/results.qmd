Distribution of test classes across the different models. The reported values are in the thousands.
:::

Since the different test cases are derived from different underlying data, the results are interpreted with that in mind. The test data distribution and source in the MS models is different than the test data in Overture Models - less volumous, much less detailed and overall different in character. Table @tbl-testcounts shows the differences in distribution per Level 4 cluster with the table values reporting the thousands of instances of a particular class. The distribution will be similar for level 3 clusters, as they are aggregates of Level 4. 

The differences in _Large Interconnected Blocks_ and _Dense Connected Developments_  between @tbl-testcountsov and @tbl-testcountsms  highlight that there are a lot less instances of buildings in dense central urban areas, since the extraction method in the MS case groups many of them together or completely discards them. However, In all cases, apart from Germany, as a percentage of the total test cases, these classes are low and therefore even high improvements in predicting these specific classes affect the overall reported accuracy relatively little. The weighted macro F1 score reported in the results in subsequent sections somewhat adresses the issue, but it accounts better for poor performance, rather than highlighting improvements. If the models perform poorly on a class that appears few times in the test data, then the weighted F1 score weights its specific score less than other classes that appear more frequently.

Nevertheless, the attached target labels come from the same source for both types of models and reflects a ground truth independent of these data issues. The detailed class by class f1 scores highlight what is possible to detect with a specific datasets.

Overall F1 scores at level 3
:::

@tbl-f1agg shows the aggregate F1 scores for the level 3 models trained on the Microsoft Building footprint and Overturemaps building footprints data. The Random, column shows the F1 scores for the model tested on randomly selected stratified data; Spatial - on the spatially aware split; OoS - stands for "Out of Sample" and is the average of the models, tested on each individual country and trained on the rest; the other columns are the specific F1 scores for each country, that make up the OoS. There are three main patterns present in the reported results.

First, overall the aggregate scores between the models trained on the two datasets are almost equal. with the Overturemaps models being very slightly higher. This suggests that at this level of disagregation of urban form, detailed characteristics of building footprints and their interactions with each other and the street network matter less. For example, the Overture data has more accurate information of building corners, adjacency, orientation and others but that does not significantly improve the overall F1 scores. 

Second, more complex and relfective of the underlying phenomena testing splits result in more realistic model evaluations for both sub-tables. The Random split has the highest score, the spatial split is always lower and the OoS average lower still. OoS is the closest score to a realistic real-world application of the model - using it to predict unseen urban fabric types. The fact that the Spatial score is closer to it, shows that randomly spliting your modelling data leads to spatial leakage and spatially aware-splits result in more realistic evaluations. Nevertheless, the Out of Sample score is lower still, which suggests that even testing the model accuracy on spatially split data overestimates model performance.   

Third, even at this high level of aggregation urban form shows signs of heterogeneity. The F1 scores for the individual countries vary both Overture and Microsoft trained models, but especially in @tbl-f1aggms. The scores for Slovakia are especially lower suggesting that it represents a more distinct type of morphology, whereas the scores for Austria are the highest suggesting that it is more similar on average to Central Europe as a whole.

Individual F1 scores for  level 3 clusters
:::

@tbl-f1class shows the F1 scores broken down by prediction class for the level 3 models. The sub-tables and columns have the same interpretation as @tbl-f1agg.

The patterns in the individual classes are mostly identical to patterns in the aggregated results. The scores for individual classes are mostly the same with the exception of the **Central Urban Developments** class, which is reflective of the higher quality in the Overture dataset. The higher prediction accuracy for this cluster does not significantly impact the overall F1 scores in @tbl-f1aggov, since it is relatively sparse compared to the rest of the classes. Similarly to @tbl-f1agg, the same patterns in accyracy across the splitting schemes holds: Random - highest; Spatial - lower, OoS - lowest. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of urban form is even more pronounced in the detailed classes, as evidenced by the even larger differences in F1 scores between the different countries.

: Overture building footprints {#tbl-f1classov4}

Individual F1 scores for  level 4 clusters
:::

It is interesting that the spatial testing pattern holds across different scales of urban form dissimilarity.


### Overture Spatial models

#### Level 4 model

#### Level 3 aggregations


## Discussion

The results from the study pertain to two areas - urban morphology and spatial modelling. 

The results show that urban morphology is heretogenous and what is important changes across scales of dissimilarity.
Furthermore, Data from heterogenous sources can be used to identify urban morphological types.


The results from the comparisons between the different testing data splitting strategies open new avenues of research.


## Stakeholder considerations

Stakeholders prefern results at the building level or aggregated to h3 grids.

Stakeholders express interest in morphotopes therefore overture is more usefull, since the concept transfers directly from the original classification.

Stakeholders like the hierarchy, therefore lower level models are better but that has to be balanced with the accuracy.
