<!-- This tries to closely match what was promised in the project proposal. -->

# Exective summary

Summary goes here.

# Theroetical basis

Kind of lit review I suppose? Probably could be adapted stuff we have in the proposal.

## Morphometric Classification Homogenisation

A brief theoretical background.

## AI Modelling using Satellite Imagery

A brief theoretical background.

# Algorithm Design

## Morphometric Classification Homogenisation

### Model architecture

One paragraph summarising the whole thing.

### Data preprocessing

### Morphometric characterisation

### Target labels

### Train/test/validation split

### Training and validation


## AI Modelling using Satellite Imagery

Most of the stuff from `technical_part_turing.qmd` except the data description.

### Data preprocessing

### Train/test split

### Unbalanced dataset

### Model architectures

#### Baseline approach (Approach A)
